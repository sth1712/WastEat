               <h2>Food waste </h2><br>
        <p>Globally ⅓ of all the food is thrown out. 385 000 tons of edible food was discarded
            in 2017 in Norway by the food industry, grocery stores, and regular consumers. This
            number does not include stakeholders that have not been mapped out, such as farmers<a href="sources.html"><span style="color:#069370">[1]</span></a>.</p>
            <p>The food industry has strict standards for how they want the produce they sell to look. This has
            created an expectation of what vegetables are supposed to look like and for example that every
            carrot is the same length and size. A direct consequence is that vegetables of strange sizes or forms
            are discarded at packing centers and instead used for animal feed <a href="sources.html"><span style="color:#069370">[7]</span></a>.</p>
            <p> An additional issue farmers have to deal with is the seasonal cycle of their produce. How large or small
            their harvest turns out is difficult to plan or anticipate, while the contract for sale to distributors is
             very often fixed. Therefore farmers often have to discard edible produce or use it as animal feed, because
              it is the only cost-effective option. With this practice we are consuming more resources than what is sustainable.
              To achieve the UN Sustainable Development goal of sustainable consumption and production it is necessary to do more
              with fewer resources <a href="sources.html"><span style="color:#069370">[6]</span></a>.

        <p> The Norwegian Directorate for Education and Training is currently in the process of implementing new
            competence goals for Norwegian schools. There is an increased focus on sustainability, especially for
            older students. Already in 4th-grade, students should be able to take advantage of local food and be aware
            of the different steps from food item to meal in the production chain. Later on, students should also be
            able to fully utilize food items as well as leftovers from cooking<a href="sources.html"><span style="color:#069370">[8]</span></a><a href="sources.html"><span style="color:#069370">[9]</span></a>.</p>
            <p>The student’s individual choices and their impact is another important topic covered in the new
            competence goals. To critically evaluate information about food production, explore food item’s climate
            impact, and understand how consumer power can impact local and global food production are fundamental
            elements of this<a href="sources.html"><span style="color:#069370">[10]</span></a><a href="sources.html"><span style="color:#069370">[11]</span></a>.</p>
            <p>A study conducted by Statistics Norway reveals that as few as 4 out of 10 who teach Food
            and Health have education in the subject. The statistics are even worse for elementary schools,
            where 8 out of 10 lack education within the field. The quality of the lessons are subsequently not equal at every
            school. Whether or not a student has sufficient knowledge of nutrition and healthy eating is therefore dependent
            on where they live and the school’s resources. As every child has a right to a quality education as per the
            UN's Sustainable Development Goals, this challenge needs a solution<a href="sources.html"><span style="color:#069370">[12]</span></a>.
