          <b>Food Waste</b>

          <p>⅓ of all food is thrown out. In Norway the waste of edible food is equivalent to 74 kilos per citizen every year</p><br>
          <p>Food production is responsible for about 25 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions</p><br>
          <p>Of the global freshwater usage, 70 percent is used for agriculture</p><br>

        <div class="box school">
            <img src="forside/education.png" alt="Teacher and students" class="figure"><br>
          <b>School</b>
            <p>Just 4 out of 10 teachers have the expertise to teach the “Food and health”-course</p><br>
            <p>Lack of knowledge about nutrition and a healthy lifestyle affects public health greatly</p><br>
            <p>Education levels impact knowledge of nutrition and a healthy lifestyle and therefore educational
              programs from an early age are necessary to combat social inequalities</p><br>

            <b>Sustainability</b>
              <p>If everyone in the world were to consume as much as every Norwegian, we would need 3,6 planet Earth’s</p><br>
              <p>To limit the effects of climate change, there needs to be a change in consumption patterns</p><br>
              <p>It is necessary to use resources more efficiently and sustainable practice must be enforced on
                 both institutional and individual level to be effective</p><br>

          <div class="info-solution-text">
        <p>We aim to solve the issue of food waste and ensuring a more sustainable future for the younger
          generations by putting the idea of “from farm to table” into practice. We get the “ugly” produce
          directly from farmers and pack it together with relevant recipes and information of how and where it was produced.
          These boxes are sent to schools that sign up for our service and the content will be used in their food and health teaching.
          This way students learn not only that vegetables come in a lot of different shapes and sizes, but they also
          get to enjoy food from local farms and see in practice what a sustainable future looks like.
